# Faculty Database System :office: :computer:

This was an university project where I designed and implemented a relational database system. 

## Requirements & tools provided 

 * A case study to analyse.
 * An established connection to a server to store the created database.
 * A set of requierements to implement:
    - Identify Entities & Develop Business Rules.
    - Construct a logical Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).  
    - Use Normalisation to validate your ERD and derive the relational schema.
    - Create tables.
    - Populate data. 
    - Construct SQL Queries. 
    
 

## Technologies & tools 
  * Visual Paradigm CE 16.2
  * Oracle SQL  Developer 
  * Windows 10
  * Microsoft Word 
  * A large white board, pen & paper! 

## Description
The project consisted on five parts:

   **First** part:
        Identifying the entities, and developing the business rules acoding to what was required from the case study. 
        
   The following image as an small example of the case study:

   Syntax used for the bussiness rules:  Each/A/An ENTITY_1 May/Must Relationship_Verb_Phrase number ENTITY_2 
   Any assumptios where cleary stated to make sure that the requirements were meet.

   Overall, these were the identified entities:

   **Second** part:
    Based on the business rules, a logical ERD was constructed using Visual Paradigm. Here primary & foreign keys, 
    disjoint & overlapping relatioships, cardinality & participatio, and assumpitions were included. All the M:N relationsips 
    resolved by creating a briding entity, and Crowâ€™s Foot notation used to show connectivity. More details can be found in the image below:
